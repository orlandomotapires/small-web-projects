# Some web Concepts

&emsp;This is a repository to post my web journey, here you will find a bunch of knowledge I have been acquiring since my beginning in web development. You can also find many folders with some simple projects that I made for studying. </br>
&emsp;Just reinforcing that here I am writing many things that I have been learning, so some information here might not be that correct :), and this repository is constantly evolving and changing. </br>
&emsp;It's also important to say that here you will find very simple descriptions about not so simple concepts, the complete content is listed in the [references](#references-and-other-content).

## **How WEB Works**

### **The HTTP Protocol**

&emsp;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.</br>

## **Programming concepts**

### **HTML**

&emsp;The HyperText Markup Language is responsible for the structure of a website.</br>
&emsp;When talking about HTML, we have a basic structure to develop our sites, this structure is composed for html, head, body and title.</br>

```HTML
    <!DOCTYPE html> 
    <html> 

        <head> 
            <title> </title> Name of the tab
        </head>

        <body> 

        </body>

    </html>
```

### **CSS**

&emsp;The Cascading Style Sheets is responsible for the style of a website.</br>

&emsp;[Here you can find many other information about CSS](CSSpart.md)</br>

### **JavaScript**

&emsp;JavaScript is responsible for the programming part it self on a website.</br>
