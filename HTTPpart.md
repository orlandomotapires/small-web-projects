# How web works

[Back To Main README](./README.md).

## **Other concepts and protocols**

- TLS (Transport Layer Security) </br>
    &emsp;Security protocol designed to provide secure communications over a computer network (used to encrypt HTTP).</br>

- SSL (Security Socket Layer) </br>
    &emsp;Identifies the identity of a website and enables an encrypted connection. Security protocol that creates an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser (Formerly used in HTTP) </br>

- URL (Uniform Resource Locator) </br>
    &emsp;Locator and identifier of a resource (website) </br>

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) </br>
    &emsp;Ensure captors arrive correctly at destination </br>

- IP (Internet Protocol) </br>
    &emsp;Computer addressing</br>

- DNS (Domain Name Servers) </br>
    &emsp;Convert a Domain to an IP Address</br>

- Proxy </br>
  &emsp;A proxy server is an intermediate program or computer used when navigating through different networks of the Internet.</br>

- SSLHandshake </br>
&emsp;Enables the SSL/TLS client and server to establish the secret keys with witch they communicate</br>

- Asymmetric public key infrastructure  </br>
&emsp;Uses two separate keys instead of one shared one: a public and a private key</br>

- Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric Cryptography)
&emsp;Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key, and data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key.

  - Encryption key

    &emsp;“In an encryption machine, something goes in at one end ‘raw’ and comes out at the other end encrypted”. UnencryptedText + key = EncryptedText </br>

- Symmetric Encryption </br>
&emsp;A single key is used to lock and unlock</br>
